          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="date">1989:</span> CERN was the largest internet node in

            World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first Web
            browser (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating
            system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext
            Transfer Protocol daemon).
